# mail-operator

**mail-operator** is a very [privacy friendly](https://github.com/flerro/mailoperator/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) 
CLI utility to manage your Gmail inbox.

You can list, download and permanently remove e-mails. Target messages are selected via a [search expression](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en).
Operations are executed on messages considering latest received messages first.

Global installation is convenient but not mandatory, **mailoperator** can be also used via a [virtualenv](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) ðŸ˜‰

Please note that the `mop` command is available only if the package is installed globally, otherwise start **mail-operator** via `./operator.py` script.

## Accessing the Gmail API 

Access to the Gmail API is possible via the Google Cloud Console. The process is not super straightforward, unfortunately. You must both setup
 [API credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent).

### API credentials (client secret)

Authentication is granted via [OAuth client id](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials):

1. Go to the [GCP Project Dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard)
2. Click on `Enable API button` and search for `GMail API`
3. Select`Credential` section on the left panel, click con `Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID`
4. Rename the downloaded JSON as `client_secret.json` and move it to the `mailoperator` directory 

### OAuth consent screen

The following scopes are required for the software to work properly.

```
Read, compose, send, and permanently delete all your email from Gmail
```

The publishing status of the application can be "Testing", but don't forget to add you as a test user.

Please note that an explicit grant to access sensitive data is displayed on first run.
